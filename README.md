###  Quantum & AI researcher working on Healthcare & Financial ML

- :briefcase: Associate Researcher, Merrimack College, North Andover, Massachusetts.
- :mortar_board: Prospective PhD; focus on Optimization for large models; robustness & privacy; biomedical (multi-omics) and clinical/financial AI; hardware-aware deployment across cloud/GPU, edge/IoT, and near-term quantum backends. [[Curriculum Vitae]](https://rahatulashakin.github.io/files/Rahatul_Ashakin_CV.pdf)
- :computer: Current projects:

• **IBD-Quantum-ESM (IBD multi-omics + ESM embeddings)**: Hybrid classical/quantum pipeline for IBD phenotyping (leakage-aware evaluation, reproducible CLI + artifacts); exploring quantum kernels (QSVC/QuantumKernel) alongside strong classical baselines.

• **CRISPR → Gene Regulation “Digital Twin” (RNA-seq + ATAC-seq + dependency screens)**: Interpretable gene regulation / GRN inference using quantum-inspired tensor networks (MPS), enabling in-silico perturbations and candidate prioritization for functional genomics follow-up.

• **Tamper-resistant BioAI foundation models**: Integrity monitoring and defenses against adversarial fine-tuning / poisoning for scientific and biomedical LLM workflows; focus on reliability and safe deployment.

• **Quantum-guided transformer optimization (QAOA/VQE)**: QAOA/VQE-assisted hyperparameter optimization and benchmarking for transformer pipelines (validated on FinBERT as a controlled benchmark; extending the workflow to biomedical NLP and omics-focused models).
